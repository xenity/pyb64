## Description

The goal here is not to create a useful base64 tool as very good ones already exist. 
No here, I just wanted to practise some python and understand base64 encoding.

## Usage :

Only text data for now.

```
pyb64.py <option> <data> 
```

## Options :

1.  '-d' or '--decode'
2.  '-e' or '--decode'

## Example :

```
$ python pyb64.py -e 'Hello, World!'

```
