## Description

The goal here is not to provide an actually useful base64 tool as very good ones already exist. 
I just wanted to understand base64 encoding and practise some pyhton.

## Usage :

Only text data for now.

```
pyb64.py <option> <data> 
```

## Options :

- -d  or --decode
- -e  or --encode

## Example :

```
$ python pyb64.py -e 'Hello, World!'

```
